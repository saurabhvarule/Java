/*
	A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16461) th	at remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it has reflectional symmetry across a vertical 	axis.The term palindromic is derived from palindrome, which refers to a word (such as rotor or racecar) whose 		spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed. The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal) are:    
	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 1	91, 202, â€¦
