# Java Learning Repository
Welcome to my Java learning repository! 🚀

Overview
This repository documents my journey as I dive into the world of Java programming. Whether you’re a fellow learner, an interviewer, or just curious, I hope you find something valuable here.

Learning Goals
Understand core Java concepts: data types, control structures, classes, and objects.
Explore advanced topics: inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and multithreading.
Solve coding challenges to reinforce understanding.


Folder Structure
basics/: Basic Java concepts and syntax.
algorithms/: Implementations of common algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.).
data-structures/: Examples of data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.).
Code Examples
Hello, Java!
Java

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}

Linked List Implementation
Java

class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
