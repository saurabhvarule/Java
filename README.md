# Java Learning Repository
Welcome to my Java learning repository! 🚀

Overview
This repository documents my journey as I dive into the world of Java programming. Whether you’re a fellow learner, an interviewer, or just curious, I hope you find something valuable here.

Learning Goals
Understand core Java concepts: data types, control structures, classes, and objects.
Explore advanced topics: inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and multithreading.
Solve coding challenges to reinforce understanding.

### Here is a simple example of a java program that prints "Hello, World!":

```java
class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.prinltn("Hello Java");
    }
}
```

## Usage

### To compile the program, use:

```bash
javac Demo.java
```

### To run the program, use:
```bash
java Demo
```
